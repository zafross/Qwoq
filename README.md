5. In the second field, enter the name of the community on reddit (For example: `Minecraft`)
6. Paste the copied token into the token field.

9. Press `START` button.


## ‚ö° Code
  The program is written using the eel library which links html, css, js with python. Web design was immediately done in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/7ZyhO41tvhen7h9H1s7JkC/Untitled). I've recently changed the design and added more settings, but there's a lot more I want to do.
  
  In fact, I am making a program only to train my skills, and it was in this program that I decided to try eel. I will be glad if you help with the development of this repository. üíú
