## ‚ö° Code
  The program is written using the eel library which links html, css, js with python. Web design was immediately done in Figma. 
In the next updates, I want to rework it a lot because in the current version the window is too small,
ugly and there are very few settings + the bot token is entered through the console (this is terrible).
  
  In fact, I am making a program only to train my skills, and it was in this program that I decided to try eel. I will be glad if you help with the development of this repository. üíú
