## ‚öôÔ∏è FIRST SETUP:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Method 1 - WITH INSTALLED PYTHON:
1. [Download latest release source code (.zip)](https://github.com/zafross/Qwoq/releases/v0.1-alpha)
2. Open cmd in the repository folder on your PC and write: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Done!

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Method 2 - WITHOUT INSTALLED PYTHON:

## ‚ùì How to use it:
1. Create a telegram bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy bot token.
2. Add the created bot to your channel as admin. [(help)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33497769/19632709)
3. Run `run.py` or `Qwoq.exe` (Depending on which method you choose) and paste the previously copied bot token into the console.
4. In the first field, enter the name of the reddit community (For example: `Minecraft`)
5. In the field on the right, enter the number of posts you want to send (For example: `15`)
6. Enter the channel ID in the last field. (Example: `@reddit_minecraft`)
7. Press `START` button.


## ‚ö° Code
  The program is written using the eel library which links html, css, js with python. Web design was immediately done in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/7ZyhO41tvhen7h9H1s7JkC/Untitled). 
In the next updates, I want to rework it a lot because in the current version the window is too small,
ugly and there are very few settings + the bot token is entered through the console (this is terrible).
  
  In fact, I am making a program only to train my skills, and it was in this program that I decided to try eel. I will be glad if you help with the development of this repository. üíú
